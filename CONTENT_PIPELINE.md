# Thought Leadership Research-to-Post Pipeline

Claude Code + OpenClaw Implementation

User: [Author]
Environment: Cursor + Claude Code
Gateway: OpenClaw (Telegram)

Purpose:
Automate discovery, research, drafting, and publishing preparation for Medium and LinkedIn thought leadership posts.

Primary Output Location:

```text
outputs/content/
```

# 1. Pipeline Overview

The pipeline converts **raw ideas and news signals** into **publishable content assets**.

Workflow:

```text
Topic discovery
↓
Research aggregation
↓
Thesis generation
↓
Medium article draft
↓
LinkedIn post derivatives
↓
Archive and reuse
```

Three internal subagents execute this pipeline:

```text
researcher
writer
editor
```

---

# 2. Required Directory Setup

```text
.claude/subagents
.claude/commands
memory/brand
data/research
outputs/content
```

Create your brand voice file before running the pipeline:

```bash
cp .claude/templates/writing_style.md.example memory/brand/writing_style.md
# Then edit memory/brand/writing_style.md with your own name, style, and audience
```

> `memory/` is gitignored and never committed. The template lives at `.claude/templates/writing_style.md.example`.
