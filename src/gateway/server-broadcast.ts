 * restarting at 1 — otherwise the backward jump is silently ignored and
 * events missed during the outage become invisible.
 *
 * Key composition: `client.id` (e.g. "openclaw-control-ui") is always
 * present; `client.instanceId` disambiguates multiple tabs/windows of the
 * same client type.  Falls back to the ephemeral `connId` when neither is
