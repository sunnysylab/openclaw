/**
 * Wait for the event loop to become responsive before starting network I/O.
 *
 * Large ESM modules (e.g. auth-profiles with bundled AJV schema compilation)
 * can trigger deferred synchronous evaluation that blocks the event loop for
 * several seconds *after* the top-level import promise resolves.  Any WebSocket
 * or HTTP connection opened during this window will time out because socket
 * data callbacks cannot fire until the blocking work finishes.
 *
 * This helper schedules short timers and watches for abnormal drift.  It
 * resolves only after two consecutive on-time callbacks, guaranteeing that any
 * deferred module-evaluation work has completed.  On systems without the
 * blocking issue this adds only ~40 ms of overhead.
 *
 * @param maxWaitMs Upper bound on how long to wait.  If the event loop is
 *   still starved after this deadline the function resolves anyway so that
 *   callers' own timeout logic can take over rather than hanging indefinitely.
