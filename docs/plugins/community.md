# Community Plugins

Community plugins are third-party packages that extend OpenClaw with new
channels, tools, providers, or other capabilities. They are built and maintained
by the community, published on [ClawHub](/tools/clawhub) or npm, and
installable with a single command.

```bash
openclaw plugins install <package-name>
```

OpenClaw checks ClawHub first and falls back to npm automatically.

## Built-in onboarding catalog for community channels

OpenClaw also maintains a small built-in catalog for first-run onboarding of
community-maintained channel plugins.

This catalog is intentionally conservative:

- It is for community **channel** plugins only.
- It is not a marketplace, ranking system, or remote registry.
- It only fills discovery gaps during first-run setup when no higher-priority
  plugin source already provides that channel.

The current source of truth lives in:

```text
src/channels/plugins/community-channel-catalog.json
```

DingTalk is the first example entry in that file, but the mechanism is generic.
Future community channel plugins should follow the same path.

### How to add a new community channel

1. Publish the plugin to npm so `openclaw plugins install <npm-spec>` works.
2. Keep the source in a public repository with setup and troubleshooting docs.
3. Expose valid `openclaw.channel` and `openclaw.install` metadata in the plugin package.
4. Point `docsPath` to plugin-owned docs, not to a page that must live in the
   main OpenClaw docs repo.
5. Add one manifest-shaped entry to `src/channels/plugins/community-channel-catalog.json`.
6. Keep the entry minimal and reviewable: package name, channel metadata, and install metadata only.

### Review bar for built-in onboarding entries

| Requirement              | Why                                                                               |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Public npm package       | The onboarding flow installs from npm on demand                                   |
| Public repository        | Maintainers and users need a reviewable source of truth                           |
| Valid plugin metadata    | The existing channel catalog parser must be able to load it without special cases |
| Plugin-owned docs        | Community plugin docs should not depend on pages in the main OpenClaw docs repo   |
| Conservative maintenance | Built-in onboarding discovery should stay curated and low-risk                    |

If a plugin does not meet that bar, it can still be documented on this page as a
community plugin without being added to the built-in onboarding catalog.

| Requirement                 | Why                                           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Published on ClawHub or npm | Users need `openclaw plugins install` to work |
| Public GitHub repo          | Source review, issue tracking, transparency   |
| Setup and usage docs        | Users need to know how to configure it        |
| Active maintenance          | Recent updates or responsive issue handling   |

Low-effort wrappers, unclear ownership, or unmaintained packages may be declined.
