# Tool-loop detection

OpenClaw can keep agents from getting stuck in repeated tool-call patterns.
The guard is **enabled by default**.

It uses gradual escalation — warning at 10 identical calls, blocking at 20 — so legitimate varied tool use is unaffected.

## Why this exists

- Detect repetitive sequences that do not make progress.
- Detect high-frequency no-result loops (same tool, same inputs, repeated errors).
- Detect specific repeated-call patterns for known polling tools.

## Configuration block

Global defaults:

```json5
{
  tools: {
    loopDetection: {
      enabled: true,
      historySize: 30,
      warningThreshold: 10,
      criticalThreshold: 20,
      globalCircuitBreakerThreshold: 30,
      detectors: {
        genericRepeat: true,
        knownPollNoProgress: true,
        pingPong: true,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Per-agent override (optional):

```json5
{
  agents: {
    list: [
      {
        id: "safe-runner",
        tools: {
          loopDetection: {
            enabled: true,
            warningThreshold: 8,
            criticalThreshold: 16,
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

To disable loop detection entirely:

```json5
{
  tools: {
    loopDetection: {
      enabled: false,
    },
  },
}
```

### Field behavior

- `enabled`: Master switch (default: `true`). Set to `false` to disable all loop detection.
- `historySize`: number of recent tool calls kept for analysis.
- `warningThreshold`: threshold before classifying a pattern as warning-only.
- `criticalThreshold`: threshold for blocking repetitive loop patterns.
- `globalCircuitBreakerThreshold`: global no-progress breaker threshold.
- `detectors.genericRepeat`: detects repeated same-tool + same-params patterns.
- `detectors.knownPollNoProgress`: detects known polling-like patterns with no state change.
- `detectors.pingPong`: detects alternating ping-pong patterns.

## Recommended setup

- Keep defaults — loop detection is already enabled with safe thresholds.
- Keep thresholds ordered as `warningThreshold < criticalThreshold < globalCircuitBreakerThreshold`.
- If false positives occur:
  - raise `warningThreshold` and/or `criticalThreshold`
  - (optionally) raise `globalCircuitBreakerThreshold`
  - disable only the detector causing issues
  - reduce `historySize` for less strict historical context

## Logs and expected behavior

When a loop is detected, OpenClaw reports a loop event and blocks or dampens the next tool-cycle depending on severity.
This protects users from runaway token spend and lockups while preserving normal tool access.

- Prefer warning and temporary suppression first.
- Escalate only when repeated evidence accumulates.

## Notes

- `tools.loopDetection` is merged with agent-level overrides.
- Per-agent config fully overrides or extends global values.
- If no config exists, loop detection runs with built-in defaults (`enabled: true`).
