# Kudosity SMS

Status: outbound SMS ready; inbound webhook utilities included (gateway route wiring planned as follow-up).

## Overview

The Kudosity SMS channel lets your OpenClaw agent send and receive SMS messages through [Kudosity](https://kudosity.com), an Australian cloud communications platform. SMS works on any phone — no app needed.

## Quick setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Kudosity account">
    Sign up at [kudosity.com/signup](https://kudosity.com/signup). A free trial is available.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get your API key">
    Go to **Settings → API Keys → Create Key** in the Kudosity dashboard.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get a sender number">
    Go to **Numbers → Lease a virtual number**, or use an existing number on your account. The number must be in E.164 format (e.g. `+61400000000`).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the onboarding wizard">
    The OpenClaw CLI will guide you through configuration:

    ```
    openclaw setup
    ```

    Select **SMS Kudosity** from the channel list and follow the prompts.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security

Kudosity webhooks do not currently support payload signing or shared secrets. For inbound SMS security, consider IP allowlisting at the network/reverse-proxy level. See the [Kudosity webhook documentation](https://developers.kudosity.com/reference/about-webhooks) for details.
