# ATR Detection Rule Mapping for OpenClaw Security Threats

[Agent Threat Rules (ATR)](https://github.com/Agent-Threat-Rule/agent-threat-rules) is an open-source set of detection rules for AI agent security threats. This document maps ATR rules to OpenClaw's documented threat categories, providing practitioners with executable detection for each threat.

**ATR version:** v0.4.0 (71 committed rules) | **License:** MIT | **Engines:** TypeScript + Python | **OWASP Agentic Top 10:** 10/10 coverage

## Why This Mapping Exists

OpenClaw's security documentation describes **what** the threats are and how to harden against them. ATR provides **how** to detect active exploitation of those threats at runtime — 71 open-source regex rules with test cases, executing in <5ms per scan.

This gives OpenClaw operators a path from "understand the threat" to "detect it in production":

1. Read the threat description in OpenClaw's security docs
2. Find the corresponding ATR rules in this mapping
3. Deploy via ATR's TypeScript/Python engine, MCP server, or convert to Splunk/Elastic queries

## Detailed Mappings

### 1. Prompt Injection & Goal Hijacking

OpenClaw's trust model assumes a single trusted operator, but **any allowed sender can steer tool calls** within the agent's policy. Prompt injection from one sender can cause actions affecting shared state. OpenClaw's security docs note: "prompt/content injection from one sender can cause actions that affect shared state, devices, or outputs."

### 2. Tool Interaction Manipulation

OpenClaw agents use tools (exec, browser, network, file tools) with delegated authority. OpenClaw docs warn: "any allowed sender can induce tool calls within the agent's policy." These rules detect manipulation of tool inputs and outputs.

| ATR Rule     | Title                                  | Severity | Relevance to OpenClaw                                |

| ATR-2026-106 | Schema-Description Contradiction       | MEDIUM   | Tool schema says one thing, description says another |

### 3. Credential & Secret Exposure

OpenClaw agents operate under user-assigned credentials. These rules detect credential theft, secret leakage, and API key exposure.

| ATR Rule     | Title                                          | Severity | Relevance to OpenClaw                                |

### 4. Skill Supply Chain Attacks

ClawHub hosts 13,729+ skills with 1,184+ known malicious entries. OpenClaw partnered with VirusTotal for malware scanning, but prompt injection and social engineering in SKILL.md files are not covered by VirusTotal.

| ATR Rule     | Title                                  | Severity | Relevance to OpenClaw                           |

### 6. Privilege Escalation & Authorization Bypass

OpenClaw's exec approvals are "guardrails for operator intent, not hostile multi-tenant isolation." These rules detect attempts to bypass those guardrails.

| ATR Rule     | Title                  | Severity | Relevance to OpenClaw                           |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |

| ATR-2026-090 | Rate Limit Evasion           | MEDIUM   | Bypassing rate limits through techniques |

### 8. Data Exfiltration & Privacy Leakage

OpenClaw docs warn: "if one shared agent has sensitive credentials/files, any allowed sender can potentially drive exfiltration via tool usage."

| ATR Rule     | Title                                | Severity | Relevance to OpenClaw           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------- |

| ATR-2026-115 | Bulk Environment Variable Harvesting | CRITICAL | Mass .env file reading          |

### 9. Session & Memory Manipulation

OpenClaw's session isolation "degrades over time" in async workloads. These rules detect manipulation of agent memory and context.

| ATR Rule     | Title                      | Severity | Relevance to OpenClaw                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |

## Quick Start

### Scan a skill before installation

```bash
npx @panguard-ai/panguard audit <skill-name>
```

### Run ATR engine programmatically

```typescript
import { ATREngine } from "agent-threat-rules";

const engine = new ATREngine();
await engine.loadRules();
const matches = engine.evaluate({
  role: "assistant",
  content: skillContent,
});
// matches: Array<{ ruleId, title, severity, confidence, match }>
```

### ATR as MCP server (self-audit)

ATR ships as an MCP server, enabling AI agents to scan other skills and self-audit their own behavior.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "atr": {
      "command": "atr",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Relationship to OpenClaw's Existing Security

| Layer                   | Tool                      | What it does                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Malware detection**   | VirusTotal (built-in)     | Binary malware signatures                                                               |
| **Configuration audit** | `openclaw security audit` | Config footguns, permissions                                                            |
| **Threat detection**    | **ATR (this mapping)**    | Prompt injection, credential theft, supply chain attacks in skill content and agent I/O |
| **Runtime monitoring**  | DefenseClaw, ClawSecure   | Real-time behavioral analysis                                                           |

ATR complements VirusTotal (which doesn't detect prompt injection) and `openclaw security audit` (which doesn't scan skill content). Together they provide defense in depth.
