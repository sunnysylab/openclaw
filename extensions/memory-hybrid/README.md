# BrainClaw (Cognitive Memory Plugin for OpenClaw)

> **"Code without memory is just a calculator. Code with BrainClaw is an entity."**

## 🧠 BrainClaw: The Cognitive Architecture Parallel

BrainClaw is more than a vector database; it is a technical attempt to replicate the core neurological functions of the human brain within an AI agent.

### 1. The Hippocampus (Working Memory Buffer)

Humans do not store every trivial "okay" or "thanks". Our brains filter noise. **BrainClaw's Working Memory Buffer** (`buffer.ts`) mimics this by staging facts and only "promoting" them to long-term storage (LanceDB) if they cross importance thresholds or are reinforced by repetition.

### 2. Associative Thinking (AMHR & Knowledge Graph)

Human memory is associative, not just semantic. When you think of "Coffee", you might recall "that cafe in Kyiv". **BrainClaw's Associative Multi-Hop Retrieval** (`index.ts`) traverses the Knowledge Graph to surface connected facts even when mathematical vector similarity is low.

### 3. Synaptic Reinforcement (7-Channel Scoring)

The more you think about something, the stronger the neural pathway becomes. **BrainClaw's 7-Channel Scoring** (`recall.ts`) directly applies this. Facts that are frequently recalled (**Reinforcement**), emotionally charged (**Emotional Tone**), or recent (**Recency**) naturally rise to the surface of the agent's consciousness.

### 4. Continuous Reflection (User Profiling)

Just as humans build a self-identity from accumulated experiences, BrainClaw's **Reflection Engine** (`reflection.ts`) analyzes the entire memory pool to generate a psychological persona and deep behavioral patterns.

## Why BrainClaw?

Standard RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems use simple vector similarity. They miss context, forget old facts, and don't understand _relationships_. BrainClaw solves this while remaining a drop-in replacement for `memory-lancedb`.

### 🧠 7-Channel Hybrid Recall Scoring

Instead of pure vector similarity, memories are ranked by a 7-channel combined mathematical scoring system. This directly mirrors how human neurology prioritizes thoughts:

```javascript
Score =
  0.42 * VectorSimilarity +
  0.16 * Importance +
  0.1 * Temporal +
  0.1 * Recency +
  0.08 * Reinforcement +
  0.08 * Graph +
  0.06 * Emotional;
```

1. **Vector (0.42)** — Pure semantic and contextual similarity.
2. **Importance (0.16)** — Facts with high emotional or practical weight (injected during Smart Capture) rise to the top.
3. **Recency (0.10)** — Uses Exponential Decay (`Math.exp(-decay * days)`). Old memories naturally fade unless reinforced.
4. **Temporal (0.10)** — Aligns "today" with memories matching the current date/context.
5. **Graph (0.08)** — Multi-hop connections in the Knowledge Graph. Highly connected nodes (like your name or core skills) naturally trigger associated memories.
6. **Reinforcement (0.08)** — Boosts for frequently recalled facts. The more a memory is accessed, the stronger its neural pathway.
7. **Emotional (0.06)** — Matches the emotional tone of the current conversation to the original memory's tone.

### 🕸️ Knowledge Graph & AMHR

When you store a memory, BrainClaw uses an LLM to extract entities and relationships:

```
Memory: "I use Python for my web projects at Acme Corp"
  → Nodes: [User (Person), Python (Language), Acme Corp (Company)]
  → Edges: [User --uses--> Python, User --works_at--> Acme Corp]
```

**Associative Multi-Hop Retrieval (AMHR)** allows the system to traverse this graph when recalling. Asking about "Python" surfaces "Acme Corp" purely through associative graph links, even if the vector similarity is low.

### 📚 Conversation Stack

To understand full context without blowing up the 15k context window (e.g. Gemma 3 limits), BrainClaw utilizes a `ConversationStack`.
It compresses each user/assistant turn into a ~30-word summary, accumulating them into a session-scoped stack.
**Result:** ~17x token compression with full context retention.

### 💡 Smart Capture & Working Memory Buffer

Traditional regex capture only catches obvious patterns like "I prefer X".
Smart Capture routes via an LLM to extract facts, placing them in a **Working Memory Buffer**. The buffer requires patterns (e.g. `importance >= 0.7`, or `mentioned > 3 times`) before promoting facts to the permanent LanceDB database. This is the exact mechanism of the human Hippocampus.

### 🪞 Memory Reflection

Generates a high-level "user profile" from all stored memories using LLM analysis. Instead of searching raw facts, it summarizes patterns.

```
Summary: "User is a Ukrainian developer who is self-teaching programming
          through AI tools, focusing on practical projects like Telegram bots."
Patterns:
  - Prefers hands-on learning over theory
  - Focuses on Python ecosystem
```

### 🧹 Memory Consolidation

Merges duplicate or similar memories into stronger consolidated facts via the `openclaw ltm consolidate` CLI command.
