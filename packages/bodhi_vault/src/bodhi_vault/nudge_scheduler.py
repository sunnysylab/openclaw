"""
bodhi_vault.nudge_scheduler — Generate and track spaced-repetition nudges.

A "nudge" is ONE question about a cluster that has crossed the criticality
threshold. It is never advice, never a prescription — just a question that
surfaces a pattern the vault has been accumulating.

Spaced-repetition logic (Ebbinghaus-derived):
    After a nudge is generated, that cluster enters a cooldown period.
    Cooldown doubles on each consecutive nudge for the same cluster:
        1st nudge  → 3 days
        2nd nudge  → 6 days
        3rd nudge  → 12 days
        4th nudge  → 24 days  (≈ 3.5 weeks)
    This prevents the same thought from drowning out new signal.

State file: ~/.openclaw/nudge-state.json
    {
      "cluster_id": {
        "count": int,           # how many times nudged
        "last_nudge_at": ISO,   # when last nudged
        "cooldown_days": float  # current cooldown
      }
    }

Nudge log: ~/.openclaw/nudges.jsonl  (append-only, one JSON per line)

Design:
- Zero external dependencies
- Deterministic (no random question selection — uses top cluster node as anchor)
- Works with empty vault (returns empty list gracefully)
- Dismissal records stored in nudge-state.json as "snoozed_until"
