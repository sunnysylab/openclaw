## Blocker: GitHub Access Unavailable

This monitoring run was unable to complete because **neither the `gh` CLI nor the GitHub MCP server tools are available** in this environment:

- `gh` CLI: not installed (`command not found`)
- `mcp__github__*` tools: not present in the deferred tool registry

No PR data, review comments, CI results, or merge-conflict status could be retrieved.

---

## Actions Taken

None. No changes were made to any branch or PR.

## PRs Requiring Human Attention

All four PRs need manual review until GitHub access is restored:

- openclaw/openclaw#45911 — fix/telegram-approval-callback-fallback
- openclaw/openclaw#45584 — feat/cron-fresh-session-option
- openclaw/openclaw#54363 — fix/chat-send-button-contrast
- openclaw/openclaw#54730 — fix/subagent-identity-fallback

## Resolution

To unblock future monitoring runs, one of the following must be present:

1. **`gh` CLI** installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`), or
2. **GitHub MCP server** configured in Claude Code settings with a valid token for the `suboss87/openclaw` → `openclaw/openclaw` scope.
